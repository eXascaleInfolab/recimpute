# ------------------------------------

# INIT_ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLD: if original data set has a correlation higher or equal than this, clustering is not necessary

# CLUSTER_ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLD: if cluster has a correlation higher or equal than this, recusion stops, cluster is accepted 
CLUSTER_ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLD: 0.85

# SIMILAR_CLUSTER_THRESHOLD: correlation btw centroids must be above this to consider the two clusters similar
SIMILAR_CLUSTER_THRESHOLD: 0.55

# CENTROID_DIST_THRESHOLD: correlation btw a sequence and its current cluster's centroid must greater than this to consider moving it to another cluster
CENTROID_DIST_THRESHOLD: 0.4

# TS_PERC_TO_COMPUTE_K: use this percentage * #sequences in a data set to compute K
TS_PERC_TO_COMPUTE_K: 0.20

# MAX_ITER: max number of iterations before the algorithm can stop early.
MAX_ITER: 500

# APPLY_MERGING: whether or not the merging process should be applied after the incremental clustering is done
APPLY_MERGING: True
